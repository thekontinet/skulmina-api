# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You'll find instructions on how to authenticate your request in the <a href='#authentication'>Authentication</a> section.
